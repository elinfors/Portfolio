            <p>ABOUT ME</p>
              <p className="aboutTitle"> 
            Curious MSc student at KTH, digitalization enthusiast and designer.
            </p>
            <p className="aboutContent">
              I have, for as long as I can remember, been torn between my creativity and analytical mindset. 
              Studying Interactive Media Technology at KTH allowed me to combine them and a whole new world of technology and design opened up. 
              During my education I have explored a wide range of technologies, strategies and problems to solve - from sustainability to e-learning.
              To me, human-centered design is the most important aspect of digitalization and I believe in a user centric digital future,
              both to ensure good user experiences and for creating value- and growth for any business.
              
              </p>
              <p className="aboutContent">
              I am a driven person who works in structured, efficient and goal-oriented ways, while always staying curious and open. 
              
              </p>
              <p className="aboutContent">
              I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s of Science in Interactive Media Technology at KTH - Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, 
              and I plan to graduate in June 2021.
